# Interview techniques

**Cut out voice from question**
- avoid voice overlapping
- incorporate question in answer


**open questions rather then closed once**ie

Tell me about ...

Describe ...

Take me back to the moment where/when...

Take me trough the moment when/where ...


What?Why? How?

What is the worst that can happen? \(

What is the worst that can happen if..?


Start wide --> go specific

7.4.1 it should flow like a conversation

7.5 flexible but in control of the interview

Write questions --> but have a list of key points instead, and maybe 2 or 3 questions.

## Body Language

Prof Mehrabian - UCLA, Communication theory :

When body language congruent then our attention is even across body language, tone and verblal, However, when body language is incongruent with the message, it attracts 55% of our attention, and Tone gets 38% and verbal goes down to the remaining 7%.



| / | When incongruent | When Congruent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Body Language | 55 | 33 |
| Tone | 38 | 33 |
| Verbal | 7 | 33 |


Where is all this usefull? in building instant rapport with people / contributors, for interviews, negotiating access etc..
