# Keeping Research Diary 

If you are working as a researcher \(but I guess this can be generalised to most production jobs and not only\) It's advisable to keep a research diary for each project.

  


and this is how you would go about:

  


---

at the Top of the page date, and time.

One column to do list, other column for priority with A, B, C etc..

ie:



  


**date and time**

| **To Do** | **Priotity** |
| :--- | :--- |
| example | A |
| example example | B |
| ~~example example example~~ | ~~C~~ |
| example example example example | A |

  


  


And then cross over the accomplished once as you go along.

This is useful to do at beginning of the day, as well as at the end of the day to pile up w what you have to do the next day and make it easier to start of the day after and switch of when you go home.

  


Then you open a new page, making a paper trail, taking notes of numbers, names, websites, and any major turning points in achieving the task. This makes it easier to keep on top of everything especially for searches that might spread over a week, and you might easily lose track of who you contacted already.

  


Also anytime you get given some more things to do, you can add them to the list and check how they priorities with everything else you have been given to do. This helps to do effective multitasking.

  


At end of the day, it's usefull to draft the outline with the things to do the next morning,Â  it makes it easyer to start again from where you left of.

  


Last but not least Never Assume, always check.**
