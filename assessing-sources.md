# Reliable Sources

What happens when things go wrong, an example

What can happen if you don’t identify non legit sources when you are researching something for a broadcaster?

Here is an example, a company called Dough Chemical, is responsible for spillage in India, a researcher at BBC world was asked to get a spoke person for the company for a live studio interview.

&lt;!-- tip: watch up to min 00:37 then pause

–&gt;

And here is what was happening behind the scene

&lt;iframe width=“100%” height=“315” src="[https://www.youtube.com/embed/OazUh0Ym8rc?rel=0&start=1585](https://www.youtube.com/embed/OazUh0Ym8rc?rel=0&start=1585)" frameborder=“0” allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;!–  
tip: fast forward to min 26:25 to see the behind the scene of the BBC world interview, for some context. --&gt;

## What went wrong for the researcher?

They failed to identify a unreliable source, a fake website, posing as the original.

The fake website:

[http://www.dowethics.com](http://www.dowethics.com/)and real website:[http://www.dow.com](http://www.dow.com/)

## How to check for Reliability?

1. **Check URL**, and weather it sounds right  
   for instance rather then[Dowethics.com](http://dowethics.com/)you are more likely to find[dow.com/ethics](http://dow.com/ethics).

2. **Google search the url**, and see if it comes up in any forum, or with anyone questioning if it’s legitimate.

3. **Verify Domain Ownership**, using:[Domaintools.com](http://www.domaintools.com/),[whois.com](http://www.whois.com/)- Search who owns it looking at the details section of the website:

* the
  **adress**
  , check in google mpas, does it seem fake? or do they withhold info? big companies generally don’t

hide contact details

-is there an official**e-mail adress**?  
do the addresses syntax matches with the one on the website ?

* is there a
  **phone number**
  ? do a reverse search on number to see who owns it, maybe give them a call?

## Another examples

Is with the world trade organization  
, Real website:  
[wto.org](http://www.wto.org/)- fake:[gatt.org](http://www.gatt.org/).

The guys behind these hoax, where making a documentary called “The Yes Men fix the world” where posing as their industrious alter-egos, where exposing corporation’s faults and responsibilities.

Another example of a oax they did was with a  
Fake New York Times, “special editions”:

Here is the behind the scenes:

It also had a fake website associated with it[NYtime-se.com](http://www.nytimes-se.com/)-where “se” was meant to stand as a special edition
