# Reliable Sources {#reliable-sources}

What happens when things go wrong, an example

What can happen if you don’t identify non legit sources when you are researching something for a broadcaster?

Here is an example, a company called Dough Chemical, is responsible for spillage in India, a researcher at BBC world was asked to get a spoke person for the company for a live studio interview.

And here is what was happening behind the scene

## What went wrong for the researcher? {#what-went-wrong-for-the-researcher}

They failed to identify a unreliable source, a fake website, posing as the original.

The fake website:

http://www.dowethics.com and real website: http://www.dow.com

## How to check for Reliability? {#how-to-check-for-reliability}

1. **Check URL**, and weather it sounds right     for instance rather then Dowethics.com you are more likely to find dow.com/ethics.

2. **Google search the url**, and see if it comes up in any forum, or with anyone questioning if it’s legitimate.

3. **Verify Domain Ownership**, using:[Domaintools.com](http://www.domaintools.com/),[whois.com](http://www.whois.com/)- Search who owns it looking at the details section of the website:

* the
  **adress**
  , check in google mpas, does it seem fake? or do they withhold info? big companies generally don’t     hide contact details

-is there an official**e-mail adress**?  do the addresses syntax matches with the one on the website ?  

* is there a
  **phone number**
  ? do a reverse search on number to see who owns it, maybe give them a call?
