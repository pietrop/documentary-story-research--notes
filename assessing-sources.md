#### Reliable Sources - What happens when things go wrong \(an example\)

## What can happen if you don't identify non legit sources when you are researching something for a broadcaster?

### Here is an example:

 A Company called Dough Chemical, is responsible for spillage in India, a researcher at BBC world was asked to get a spoke person for the company for a live studio interview,



Video  


Here is the interview: 

tip: watch up to min 00:37 then pause  

 and here is what was happening behind the scene:

  


Video



  tip: fast forward to min 26:25 to see the behind the scene of the BBC world interview, for some context.



### So, what went wrong for the researcher?

He failed to identify a unreliable source, a fake website, posing as the original.

the fake website: http://www.dowethics.com    and   real website: http://www.dow.com



### So, how to check for Reliability? 

1.

**Check URL**

, and weather it sounds right  for instance rather then Dowethics.com you are more likely to find dow.com/ethics.

  


2.

**Google search the url**

, and see if it comes up in any forum, or with anyone questioning if it's legitimate.

  


3.

**Verify Domain Ownership**

, using:

[Domaintools.com](http://www.domaintools.com/)

[whois.com](http://www.whois.com/)

 - Search who owns it looking at the details section of the website:

  


- the

**adress**

, check in google mpas, does it seem fake? or do they withhold info? big companies generally don’t   hide contact details

  


-is there an official

**e-mail adress**

?  do the addresses syntax matches with the one on the website ?  

  


- is there a

**phone number**

?  do a reverse search on number to see who owns it, maybe give them a call?
