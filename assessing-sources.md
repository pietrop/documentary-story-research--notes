# Reliable Sources

What happens when things go wrong, an example

## What can happen if you don't identify non legit sources when you are researching something for a broadcaster?

Here is an example, a company called Dough Chemical, is responsible for spillage in India, a researcher at BBC world was asked to get a spoke person for the company for a live studio interview.

<!--  tip: fast forward to min 26:25 to see the behind the scene of the BBC world interview, for some context. -->

### So, What went wrong for the researcher?

They failed to identify a unreliable source, a fake website, posing as the original.

The fake website: 

http://www.dowethics.com and real website: http://www.dow.com



### So, how to check for Reliability?

1. **Check URL**, and weather it sounds right  for instance rather then Dowethics.com you are more likely to find dow.com/ethics.

2. **Google search the url**, and see if it comes up in any forum, or with anyone questioning if it's legitimate.

3. **Verify Domain Ownership**, using: [Domaintools.com](http://www.domaintools.com/), [whois.com](http://www.whois.com/) - Search who owns it looking at the details section of the website:

- the **adress**, check in google mpas, does it seem fake? or do they withhold info? big companies generally don’t   hide contact details

-is there an official **e-mail adress**?  do the addresses syntax matches with the one on the website ?  

- is there a **phone number**? do a reverse search on number to see who owns it, maybe give them a call?



### Another examples

Is with the world trade organization , Real website:  [wto.org](http://www.wto.org/) - fake: [gatt.org](http://www.gatt.org/) .

The guys behind these hoax, where making a documentary called "The Yes Men fix the world" where posing as their industrious alter-egos, where exposing corporation's faults and responsibilities.

Another example of a oax they did was with a  Fake New York Times, "special editions":

It also had a fake website associated with it [NYtime-se.com](http://www.nytimes-se.com/) -where “se” was meant to stand as a special edition  .
