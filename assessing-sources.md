## HowtocheckforReliability?

1. **CheckURL**, and weather it sounds right     for instance rather then Dowethics.com you are more likely to find dow.com/ethics.

2. **Googlesearchtheurl**, and see if it comes up in any forum, or with anyone questioning if it's legitimate.

3. **VerifyDomainOwnership**, using:[Domaintools.com](http://www.domaintools.com/),[whois.com](http://www.whois.com/)- Search who owns it looking at the details section of the website:

4. the**adress**, check in google mpas, does it seem fake? or do they withhold info? big companies generally don’t      hide contact details
