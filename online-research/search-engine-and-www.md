## 1. Search engines & Searches

#### Keywords Search engines & Directory search engines

There are two main type of search engines: Keywords Search engines & Directory search engines

  


**Keywords Search engines**: Google  Which Not soo good for searching concepts but **Good if you know what you are looking for**. 

The way it works is a machine classifies internet pages, using algorithms, based mostly on popularity of links to and form.  

  


**Directory search engines**: Yahoo Directories. At first glance not as fast as searching in Google, but **good if you don’t know what you are looking for**, as it lets you explore categories. 

it also has a **regional sections**, with details on local gov, and country guides. 

The Way it works is a team of editors is classifying the sites.

  


**Meta search engine**  
Meta search engine searches trough other search engines. list on uk-osint.net  
ie copernic - desktop tool - meta slate seach

  


#### Google Advanced search

Search Engine Results Change in time and over time.  
To make the most of them Think keywords, and use[Google Advanced Search](http://www.google.com.au/advanced_search) Syntax  and  Boolean Logic \(AND OR NOT\) 

  


- Exact phrase **“ ”**

 -Language 

best is to search across languages and then translate

-Region

  


 -last updated, ie for news or recent change of contact details

  


 -File tipe. **filetype:pdf  ** or doc or  xls .

 usefull to retrieve e-mail addresses or phone numbers from documents

  


-find pages that link to a URL,   **link:sitename.com**

helps finding people interested in that topic. ie fans website to celebs linking to official site 

  


- search inside a site, **site:nameofsite.com**

to narrow down your searches to a specific source



- **Include a "fill in the blank"**query \* query- **Search for a number range**number..number

-**Include similar words**~query

  


**Boolean syntax **

- **OR**

  


- **AND**

  


**- Exclude a word**-query  ie “Jhon Jonson” - football 

to exclude irrelevant results.

  


These can also be used when searching google images.



#### Searching Contact details 

**Phone numbers and post codes **

for phone numbers, try with and without the zero, with and without the country code ie +44.

  


**Searching Adresses**

When searching postcodes, phone numbers, number plates or other code made of numbers and/or  letters.  try all the different combinations of spaces, using the exact phrase syntax " ".



Other ways following similar  principles as to the phone number,  search only first line of address.

**cache:website.com/page**

  


when we are searching we are searching the search engine not the internet.  
we are searching Google’s memory. Cache shows you google’s copy.



So if the website has been updated and changes are no longer there you could still find it in google chache .

  


-  if you are searching sensitive topic and don’t want owner of website to know you’ve visited, looking at cache, owner of site won’t know you have visited.  
- retrieve info no longer there.  
- it highlights words you are looking for in the page

- [Firefox addons  Google Cache](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/google-cache-tool/).  
  
yahoo and other search engine have cache as well.

  


Here is how it works: http://www.googleguide.com/cached\_pages.html  

  


please note that “The Cached link will be omitted for sites whose owners have requested that Google remove the cached version or not cache their content, as well as any sites Google hasn’t indexed."  

  


  


**Archive.org **

Snapshots of the internet dating back 1996. Useful if you are doing a back search on how a website changed.  http://Archive.org 

  


**web page date**  
how to tell if a webapge is out of date, working out when it was last uploaded on the internet.  
  
javascript:alert\(document.lastModified\)  
  
ad that as book mark, in firefox,  tells you what time a page was imported to the website.  
-open page  
- click bookmark  
- you get details of time page was uploaded on internet.

  


#### To make Country specific searches

To narrow down searches to a specific country you can use country specific search engine  
index:  [www.searchenginecolossus.com](http://www.searchenginecolossus.com/)  
Rather then Google, Bing, Yahoo, Altavista .  
  
in Google you can chose, pages from the uk \(to make it country specific\).

or in Yahoo directories, you can go into country specific listings.

  


  


## 2. Search Engine and HTML pages Source code

How does a search engine work?

it looks at the source code of the pages looking at  
- site  
-metatags/keywords  
- full text content  
  
file such as robots.txt are used to stop search engines 

  
right clicking on a page \(ie whitehouse.gov\) you can get sourcecode, see title, and keywords.

  
**sourcecode and hidden messages**  
Everything that appeans on website is in sourcecode but not the otherway a round.  
  
Source code can be used to hide stuff/messages  
font of same colour as background can be used to hide messages \(Ctrl + A selecting everything you can see\).  
  
uk-osint.net/1  
uk-osint.net/2  
  
if a site does not look right, select all or look at soucecode.  
  
uk-osint.net/3

Costumized google search on other websites  
Google on AOL gives you only 40% of the results.
