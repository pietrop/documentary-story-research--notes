Step 1 : **Who is Search** \(free\) 

onwww.domaintools.com \(70£ for a year for access\) or  whois.com

Look at who owns/ in details section website,big companies generally don’t  In contact details

- Name ?Search

**- Adress**, check in google mpas, fake? or withold info? 

- official **e-mail adress**? adresses matches? 

**- phone number** \(use reverse search on number to see who owns it\)  

  
Search name and "first line of adress in".

#### Step 2: **check history of changes** \(pay\) find the **name** that it was registered to the first time, credit card payment matching original **address** registered to purchase.

#### do these two match the current owner? if not what is the relationship between the two?

  


### Reverse Who is search

\[sources and resouces: uk-oisnt.net/whoandwhere.html\]  


Step 1: domain tools&gt; check .co.uk

if you only got someone's **e-mail adress** by seeing how many domains someone owns,

you might get other contact details \( landline or mobile **number**, **adress** etc.. \) and see what they are up to \(registered domain might provide leads for further research\).

  


However with .co.uk Nominet and individual can opt not to display their adress but if they also registered the .com then you can see the adress as .com doesn’t let them opt out.  
  
if a business opt to not display details of address, you can report it to nominet, and they’ll make it visible within 5 days. \[nominet link\]

  


Step 2 -  net2.co.uk &gt; check if .com or other same are taken.

if they opted out showing their details in the .co.uk registration, by finding**which other domain names are available or taken with same name** ie .com you can then 

  
Step 3 go on domains tools &gt; check .com 

or other a info found ie adress, phone, e-mail, should be visible.  
for reverse search and find out what are domains have been registered.  
  
  
**Downlaodable software that has less restrictions**, such as  
samspade, \(windows\)  covert ops

\[montegue for webscraping ?\]  
  
  
uk-osint.net - software links - network tools  
  
This is how for instance you work out what a company is planning, ie apple ipad.  
for instance they would register all the domains for a new product so that no one else takes them.  
  
same with politician. to see what they are coming up with, or what else they are behind.\(ie connections\)  
  
Question to ask is “why as he bought it?”
