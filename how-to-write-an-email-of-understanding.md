# how to write an "e-mail of understanding" 

Phone calls are great, quicker direct, no waiting a round etc... but is useful to send a so calledÂ  "e-mail of understanding" after the phone call to keep a record of it and leave to memory (yours and of the contributor) as little as possible. This might seems fairly basic, but when you are in the mist of multitasking it can be useful to have a simple outline to go back to.

  

## And here is a possible outline:

- Great talking to you
- This is what we agreed on (in bullet points)
- Terms and conditions
   (if any)
- Fees (if any)
- If you could please confirm we are on the same page
- Kind regards
