# Reliable sources

When you ask who might have already researched the topic, to asses reliability you need to find multiple sources. Using the Journalistic rule of 3: Cross checking with at least 3 **reliable** sources.

## 1 Start from a 'safe website':
- Academic department website
- Campaign organizations, and ask or look for case studies

## 2 "Phone bashing"

Not appropriate for every project but faster then waiting for e-mails that might or might not be answered.

## 3 Contact book of research contacts

Over time make your own database.
